BASIC AGREEMENT
Licensor: Krucial Holdings, LLC ("PhoenixPME")
Licensee: Anyone using this software commercially ("You")
What this means: If you use this to make money, you agree to these terms.

WHAT'S PROTECTED (MY INNOVATION)
These are MY ideas that you can't copy without paying:
- 1.5% Insurance Model - Precious metals insurance at 1.5% total cost
- Risk Pricing - Vault storage: -40%, Home storage: +50%
- RLUSD Escrow - 1% of every transaction goes to RLUSD pool
- Customer Savings - 50-81% cheaper than traditional insurance proof

COMMERCIAL USE = YOU PAY
Free Use (GPL-3.0):
- Learning, testing, personal projects
- No revenue generated
- Open source rules apply

Commercial Use (YOU PAY):
- Making money from this software
- Charging fees to users
- Running a business with this code
- REQUIRES THIS LICENSE

SIMPLE FEE STRUCTURE
If you use this commercially:
Per transaction: 1.1% to RLUSD escrow
• 1.0% → Insurance pool
• 0.1% → My payment
Smart contract collects automatically. All on-chain.

HOW PAYMENTS WORK
Step 1: Smart contract takes 1.1% per transaction
Step 2: Sends to RLUSD escrow automatically
Step 3: Everything visible on XRPL ledger

TX BLOCKCHAIN RULES
When TX launches (Coreum + Sologenic):
- You can deploy on TX for free
- No extra fees for TX
- Use TX features (Smart Tokens, XRPL bridge, DEX)
- My 1.5% model stays protected on TX too

TX can't:
- Copy my 1.5% precious metals insurance
- Offer cheaper precious metals insurance
- Claim they invented this model

WHAT YOU MUST DO
Required:
- Smart contract must collect 1.1% per transaction
- Never charge >1.5% for precious metals insurance
- Code must be transparent about fees
- No hiding the 1.1% collection

WHAT YOU CAN'T DO
Prohibited:
- Charge over 2.0% for precious metals insurance
- Skip the RLUSD escrow payments
- Hide fees from users
- Claim you invented the 1.5% model
- White-label without telling me

ENFORCEMENT
How I'll know:
- Smart contracts track usage
- XRPL shows RLUSD payments
- Code is open source
- Blockchain doesn't lie

If you don't pay:
1. Smart contract stops your platform
2. License revoked
3. Legal action
